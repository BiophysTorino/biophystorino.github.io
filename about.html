            <p>
                In our computational biology division, we leverage advanced computational techniques to study gene regulation mechanisms. By integrating bioinformatics, statistical modeling, and machine learning, we aim to decipher the complex networks governing gene expression. Additionally, we investigate scale laws that govern biological systems, seeking to uncover universal principles underlying biological organization. Furthermore, our research delves into the intrinsic dimensions of biological datasets, employing dimensionality reduction and manifold learning methods to extract meaningful insights from complex biological data.

                <b>Neural Networks</b></p>
                <p>
                Our neural networks section is dedicated to theoretical explorations of artificial intelligence. We engage in research that advances our understanding of neural network architectures, investigating topics such as deep learning theory, neural network optimization, and algorithmic design. By developing novel theoretical frameworks, we aim to enhance the interpretability, efficiency, and robustness of neural networks.
