            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We are a dynamic research group at the University of Turin dedicated to exploring cutting-edge advancements at the 
                intersection of computational biology and neural networks. Our team comprises passionate researchers driven by a 
                common goal: to unravel the complexities of biological systems through innovative computational methods.

            <p><b>Computational Biology</b></p>
            <p>
                In our computational biology division, we leverage advanced computational techniques to study gene regulation mechanisms. 
                By integrating bioinformatics, statistical modeling, and machine learning, we aim to decipher the complex networks 
                governing gene expression. Additionally, we investigate scale laws that govern biological systems, seeking to uncover 
                universal principles underlying biological organization. Furthermore, our research delves into the intrinsic dimensions of 
                biological datasets, employing dimensionality reduction and manifold learning methods to extract meaningful insights from 
                complex biological data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Neural Networks</b></p>
                <p>
                Our neural networks section is dedicated to theoretical explorations of artificial intelligence. 
                We believe that it is crucial to focus our efforts on the theoretical aspects of neural networks,
                given that their development relies not on a deep understanding but on trial and error. 
                We believe that taking tools from physics such as statistqical mechanics and dynamical systems theory and applying it to
                neural networks can help us understand the underlying principles of these systems.
